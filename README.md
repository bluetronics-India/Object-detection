# Object-detection
The project classifies the objects in every image into a pre-defined class. In this project, we have compared the results found using a simple baseline(subsampled pixel points passed to a SVM), Principal Component Analysis (PCA),  Haar-like features (Viola-Jones), Bag Of Words model and a Convolutional Neural Network.
