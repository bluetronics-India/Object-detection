# Object-detection
The project classifies the objects in every image into a pre-defined class. In this project, we have compared the results found using a simple baseline(subsampled pixel points passed to a SVM), Principal Component Analysis (PCA),  Haar-like features (Viola-Jones), Bag Of Words model and a Convolutional Neural Network.

#### Plan of action

* Principal component analysis
  - Image => nxn vector becomes n^2 x 1 vector
  - Normalize - Get average and subtract it
  - Take Transpose and multiply it - This is the covariance matrix
  - Get eigen vector and values
  - <DO SOMETHING WITH IT>


* Viola jones - Haar like feature -> Read about it
